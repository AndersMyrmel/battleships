While playing games on PC or mobile, this thought must have crossed your mind:

“How can I create the one?”

Well, now you can!

If you want to build something interesting while having fun, this project is just perfect for you.

Battleship is a multiplayer game in which a few ships are randomly arranged in a grid. And then a player tries to shoot at the opponent’s grid. The objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player’s all ships. You can start with single-player game logic and then turn it into a multiplayer game. And finally, you can style it with advanced CSS. Just like the former project we can use WebSocket to establish a real-time conversation between client and server.

Well, later on, you can also sell this game and earn some cash.

Bonus tip: Try styling your game with animation
